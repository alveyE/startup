# Notes

Learned how to use git and resolve merge conflicts.

Learned the basics of html elements

Basic flow of application is

Homepage - Users can browse groceries and add to list

Login - Login or create account (this is neccesary to save grocery lists)

List - User can view their grocery list, edit quantities, and the application does the math to find the cheapest store for them based on their list

Sales - Shows current sales going on (this is where the websocket will be used as it will live update sales found)

Product - The product page will focus on one product showing a breakdown of price at each
